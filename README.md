# Octavian Data Repository

This is the [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) for
the [Octavian](https://octavian.app) learning app.

All files uploaded through the interface are merged into this repository. All changes from pull requests are reflected
with some delay on the Octavian website.

Currently, the repository contains files of the following types:

- mscx - native uncompressed [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) format, XML
- png - 250x250 cover image
- txt - fingering files in the [special format](https://github.com/geniot/octavian-docs/wiki/Fingering-File-Format)

If you found a place in the notation that needs to be fixed, please create a pull request. Consider it a bug.

You can also submit your own sheet music and fingering files. All contributions are welcome.
